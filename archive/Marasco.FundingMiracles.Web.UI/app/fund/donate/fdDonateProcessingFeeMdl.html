        This is the transaction fee charged by our credit card provider,
        WePay (2.9% +$0.30 of your donation). Most online fundraising
        sites take this fee from the amount given to the beneficiary. So if you donated
        $100 to a fund, only $96.70 goes to the beneficiary as $3.30
        is taken out as a transaction fee by WePay.
        Funding Miracles gives you the option to cover these
        costs so that the beneficiary gets the full amount of your intended donation.
        If you select this option, your total costs would be $103.30 (example).
