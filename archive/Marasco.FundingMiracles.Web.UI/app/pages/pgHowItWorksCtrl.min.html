Within a few steps, you can create your own personalized fundraising campaign and reach out to your friends and family. Share your story on Facebook, or send an email to the people in your life to get the word out in order to get to your fundraising goal quicker.</p><div class="headline"><h3>Who can I raise money for?</h3></div><p>Anyone. We typically have people create fundraisers for themselves and loved ones. The beauty of crowdfunding is that anyone can do it for anyone. With Miracles, we provide the ability to create campaigns and the tools to spread the word.</p><div class="headline"><h3>How much does it cost?</h3></div><p>There is absolutely no charge to create a campaign. The only charge is the transaction fee that goes to an online payment service provider. This is approximately 2.9% +$0.30 from each transaction. Unlike other websites who charge an additional 5%-10% on top of transaction fees, Miracles DOES NOT have any service charges whatsoever.</p><p>We believe that the all donations should go to the beneficiary. We pride ourselves on not charging the beneficiary or the donor any additional fees for our services. In fact, we’ve given the option for donors to cover the transaction fees so that the beneficiary gets the full amount.</p><p><div class="headline"><h3>How does Miracles operate without charging fees?</h3></div><p>Just like all businesses, we must find a way to keep the lights on while offering free services. Supporters are able to donate any amount to Miracles’ operating costs before they complete their transaction.</p><div class="headline"><h3>How do I create an account?</h3></div><p>You can create an account by entering in all the required information on the Register Page. The easiest and most effective way is by using your Facebook Login. This will allow you share your fundraiser on your Facebook page and connect with your friends.</p><div class="headline"><h3>Can I create more than one fundraiser?</h3></div><p>Another advantage of creating an account with Miracles is that we don’t restrict the number of campaigns you create. So create a campaign for yourself and for a loved one and help those in need.</p><div class="headline"><h3>How do I get my money?</h3></div></div><div class="col-md-4"></div></div></div></div>
