                    <h3>Set Realististic Goals (at first)</h3>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Setting moderate goals can help you generate the momentum you need to increase your amount at
                    at a later time.  Keep in mind the costs the beneficiary may incur and be sure to include those costs
                    in your goal amount.  When your campaign is achieving good momentum raise the goal slightly and be
                    sure to include information as to why more money may be needed in your update posts.

                    <h3>Short, Catchy Names and Subject Lines</h3>

                <p>
                    A good title can go a long way when it comes to drawing donors to your campaign.  Think
                    of a couple of keywords (First/Last Name, City, Event, etc) that people can use to
                    search for your fundraiser.  Keep it short and simple, yet effective.

                <p>
                    <b>Example of Bad Title/Name:</b><br />

                    Renew Your Commitment to Clean up
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>What's wrong with this?</b><br />

                    Aside from being impersonal, you may also be intimidating your donors to take on a
                    very serious issue -- that they are the only ones responsible for keeping our oceans clean.
                </p>


                <p>
                    <b>Example of Good Title/Name:</b><br />

                    Help Keep Our Dolphins Safe By Keeping Oceans in Pacific Beach
                </p>

                <p>
                    This is a good subject line because it’s focused, local, timely, and a bit emotional.
                    Who doesn’t want to keep our oceans clean and save the dolphins to boot?

                    <h3>The short and sweet of it.  Tell Your Story</h3>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Now that you've hoooked your audience with your catchy name, it's time to engage them with a brief,
                    heartfelt story about your cause.  Just remember, you don't need to be the world's greatest author or storyteller
                    to tell a compelling story.  You have access to a great story and describing with warm words will
                    be beneficial to you or the beneficiary.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You should clearly state your goals, deadlines, and the impact a potential donor can have through you campaign.
                    Tell your members how their donations will have a positive impact on your cause and be as detailed as possilbe.
                    A good example: "Your $50 donation will help feed 3 people for an entire week."

                    To help you write your story, search for other fundraisers on Funding Miracles.com and use them as a template
                    for telling your own story.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If possible, include an address where people can send money if they choose.

                    <h3>Email, Email, Email</h3>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Social Media is good and sometimes great but its still second fiddle to email when it comes to soliciting
                    online donations.  You can have the best social media network in existence with all the shiny new toys
                    but time and time again email has proven to be much more effective and less expensive.

                </p>
                <p>
                    A up and coming contender is the use of both email and social media together to attract supporters.
                    By day you can create ads to reach out to supporters and by night you can send email communications
                    to your close friends and families who more often than not prefer private messages.  
                </p>   
                <p>
                    Below are some other tips you can use in regards to email
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Create an email signature that reflects your cause during your campaign.  This can indirectly ask for support
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Send Emails regularly.  By keeping your supporters engaged your chance of success increases with every
                            email you send out.  **NOTE** There is a balance here to consider in regards to how many emails to send 
                            in what time frames.  Be ambitious but judicious.  Dont' send 3 emails in 3 days as you'll most likely
                            wind up on a spam list or worse turn off your supporters.  1-2 emails should suffice.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                    <h3>A picture is worth a thousand words and videos even more</h3>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Whether you post on social media or the campaign itself be sure to include images as content provided along
                    with an image has been proven to be far more effective recruiting tool for supporters and potential donors.  
                    Short, compelling, and thoughtful videos could also improve your outreach significantly and are a great 
                    tool for sharing and even saying "Thanks".  Since this is such an important part and contributing factor
                    to your campaign's success, we recommend large, clear, high resolution photos and videos.

                    <h3>Post Updates</h3>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Donors and future supporters are always curious to know how beneficiaries are doing and posting updates
                    are a great way to keep them informed as well as engaged.   Be sure to not only update your fundraiser but also
                    all of your social media platforms as well (facebook, twitter, instagram, snapchat, etc).  The frequency is also 
                    important and we recommend 1-2 updates per week.  Remember, the success of your campaign can be directly tied
                    to the frequency of your updates.  Keep the supporters update on the good news as well as bad (even though it hurts)

                    are a great way to keep them informed as well as engaged. When the fundraiser is over you'll want to conclude
                    with a message of gratitude along with any corresponding content, videos, images, or links to news coverages
